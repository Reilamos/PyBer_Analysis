# PyBer_Analysis

Python 3.7.11, Jupyter 6.4.5 Final Upload PyBer_Challenge

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
   V. Isualize has given Omar and I a new assignment. We are to create a graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. Then we are to summarize how the data differs by city type and how to use the decisions. We will use the groupby() function with the count() amd sum() functions to get the total drivers, rides, and fares by city type. We then calculated the average fare per driver and ride. We are take these data sets and reformat into a new dataframe. We then created a line graph depicting total fares for each city between the months of January and April of 2019.

### Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

  *The Rural demographic is the lowest amount of riders, drivers, and total fares. The average Fare per Ride however is the most.
  *Urban Cities have the most of riders, drivers, and total fares. The average Fare per Ride however is the least.

### Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

*Employer Recommendatinos
  *We can see by this data there are a few notable peaks and dips in this data. Near the end of Febuary we see that there is a peak in all 3 cities. Perhaps this      could be attested to spring break vacations. I recommend increasing ride share prices at this time.
  *Rural areas have less frequent rides which leads to higher fares which can surmize is do to longer distant traveled. Perhaps the employer can offer a monthly ride share as rural people travel less but pay more. The incentive would be to have them travel more with their monthly pass.
  *The Suburban data suggests they are the only ones that have an uptic in ridesharing late in April. Perhaps this suggest there are congestion in traffic in late april with heavy rains or some other geopraphical feature.
